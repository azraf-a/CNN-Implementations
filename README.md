Implementations for UNet and DetNet for fluoresence microscopy and biomedical imaging. Papers available at:
DetNet - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI.2019.8759234
UNet - DOI: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4_28

Please review the papers when you have the chance! They're very insightful reads.

Please note that the struc files will output the model summary so you can check out how the various layers are stacked.

The files without struc have been implemented to perform image segmentation on data collected from Kaggle's 2018 Data Science Bowl at https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/data

Please refer to the link for further information on the dataset. As long as the python files are modified to point to the correct directory containing the stage1_test and stage1_train files, you should be good to go!

Please reach out to me aa3641@columbia.edu or aa8542@nyu.edu if you have any questions or require further guidance on using these files. 

Happy coding!
